## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Here's an overview of the web development process for the Udacity Travel App project:

Planning and Design: The first step in any web development project is planning and design. During this phase, the project requirements are defined, and the overall structure and layout of the application are determined. The design may include wireframing, creating mockups, and deciding on the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) elements.

Front-end Development: The front-end development involves implementing the visual and interactive components of the application. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are commonly used languages for front-end development. The application layout, styling, and user interface are created during this phase. The front-end also involves integrating any third-party libraries or frameworks that may be required.

Back-end Development: The back-end development focuses on building the server-side components and logic of the application. It involves implementing the business logic, handling user requests, and managing data. Back-end technologies such as server-side frameworks (e.g., Node.js, Django, Ruby on Rails) and databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) are used to develop the back-end functionalities.

APIs and Data Integration: To provide travel-related information to users, the Udacity Travel App may integrate with various APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). APIs allow the application to fetch data from external sources such as travel agencies, weather services, mapping services, etc. The data obtained from these APIs can be used to provide real-time information to users, such as flight details, hotel availability, weather forecasts, and points of interest.

User Authentication and Security: User authentication and security are crucial aspects of any web application. It involves implementing features like user registration, login, and password management. Security measures such as encryption, secure communication (HTTPS), and input validation should be implemented to protect user data.

Testing and Debugging: Throughout the development process, testing and debugging are essential to ensure that the application functions as intended. Various testing techniques, such as unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing, can be employed to identify and fix bugs or issues.

Deployment: Once the development and testing phases are complete, the application is prepared for deployment. It involves setting up the necessary infrastructure, such as servers, databases, and domain names. The application is then deployed to a production environment, making it accessible to users.

Maintenance and Updates: After deployment, the web application requires ongoing maintenance and updates. This includes monitoring the application's performance, addressing any issues or bugs reported by users, and implementing new features or enhancements based on user feedback.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Web Browser: You will need a modern web browser such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, or Microsoft Edge to run and test the web application.

Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE): You will need a text editor or IDE to write and edit the code for the project. Popular options include Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, Atom, or JetBrains WebStorm.

**Node.js Version**: Ensure you have Node.js version 20.10.0 installed. You can check your Node.js version by running the command `node -v` in your terminal. If your version differs, you may need to switch to the correct version or adjust the project dependencies accordingly.

Package Manager: Depending on the project setup, you may need a package manager like npm (Node Package Manager) or Yarn to manage project dependencies and install external libraries or frameworks. npm is included with Node.js, so it will be installed automatically when you install Node.js. Yarn can be installed separately by following the instructions on the Yarn website.

Server-side Frameworks and Libraries: If the project requires a server-side framework like Express.js, Django, Ruby on Rails, or any other framework, you will need to install the framework and any associated dependencies. This can typically be done using the package manager (e.g., npm install express) or by following the framework's documentation.

### Installing

you need the following:
npm install ----> to install all the required dependencies
notice: you may still need to download the nodeomon as a dependency

make your env file with new names and add them to the server with the new names
for example USERNAME1 = // instead of USERNAME and make sure you do that too when you add the name to the server file.

to get the keys like username and weatherbit key you need to create them yourself and add them with different names
to the env file and still make the changes based on that

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

npm run test will run jest in the terminal and get you the results
you are free to make more jest testing on your version of the project.

## üöÄ Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>

npm run build to get the live version of a new build after you have installed the packages and setup new environment keys and added them to the server functions in a proper way.
